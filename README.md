## Description
# LAN Security Implementation using Cisco Packet Tracer

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a secure Local Area Network (LAN) using Cisco Packet Tracer. The main objective is to apply fundamental LAN security concepts to protect network devices, control access, and reduce internal security threats.

The network is segmented using Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) to separate users based on departments, which limits unauthorized communication and improves overall security. Switch port security is configured to restrict the number of devices that can connect to access ports, preventing unauthorized devices from joining the network.

Access Control Lists (ACLs) are implemented to control traffic flow between VLANs, ensuring that only permitted communication is allowed. DHCP Snooping is enabled to protect the network from rogue DHCP servers, while Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is used to prevent ARP spoofing attacks within the LAN.

This project is intended for educational purposes and is suitable for networking courses, lab practice, and security demonstrations. The Packet Tracer (.pkt) file can be opened using Cisco Packet Tracer version 8.0 or later.
